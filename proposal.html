        <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
        
        <p>
            When creating their own art pieces, many designers 
            and artists would borrow ideas from the masterpieces' 
            palettes. By analyzing the color choices' expressive 
            and conceptual intention, artists gain inspiration and 
            may put them into their own work. This project aims to 
            display and categorize a gallery of famous paintings by 
            their dominating colors. With our web app, artists could 
            choose the paintings to observe and learn more selectively; 
            they may pick based on their interests in the palettes 
            they like. Other than that, showing the dominating colors 
            could help artists to identify the key tone of the paintings 
            more intuitively. At the same time, our web app also 
            encourages ordinary people to appreciate art better.</p>

            Nowadays, numerous existing websites collect masterpiece 
            images, while ranking them and displaying them in 
            tile view. However, not many focus on the problem of 
            displaying masters’ color-selections along with art 
            pieces to give the viewer clearer visual perceptions. 
            Under the masterpiece section, Pinterest exhibits a 
            mass of famous paintings along with their name, year, 
            and painter only. Similarly, the website, Artst, is 
            consistent with the same types of information. 
            Compared with Pinterest, it chooses to include 
            more description of the painting's background. 
            Unlike the previous two, the website Color Lisa 
            displays the artists’ names and provides palettes 
            of their most famous paintings. However, it doesn’t 
            include the painting's image; when clicking on the 
            painting’s name, it would direct users to its 
            introductory page, including more detailed 
            information, which also does not fulfill our request.

        <h2>App Description</h2>

        <p>
            Our target users are all those who love art, especially artists 
            and designers. By interacting with our app, people can further 
            explore ideas in color-selection from masterpieces. We will 
            provide information on masterpieces inside our app, including the 
            main color composition and basic background information. To be 
            more specific, we will extract the main color palette (including the percentage) 
            of each masterpiece using an online color extraction tool (TinEye Labs). 
            At the same time, we will collect the background information of 
            those works from Wikipedia.
        </p>
            
        <p>
            The Expected Interactions:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                On the homepage, our users will be provided with various color 
            palettes (coloring scheme). From there,  they can explore different palettes. 
            When the users choose one of them, the web app will show the matched work, 
            which uses this palette as its main color-selection. In this case, 
            our web app will provide users with visual information by clicking 
            the palettes. 
            </li>
            <li>
                There will also be a search bar on top of our web app, 
            where users can directly search for the masterpiece they are interested in. 
            In this search bar interaction, users can input either the name of works 
            or the author’s name. The web app will then provide the corresponding work 
            with both the main color-selection information and the background information 
            of that work.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Our web app can provide inspiration and color-selection ideas for artists 
            and designers who want to get examples of how masters use different palettes 
            to create works. Furthermore, we provide two main ways to help our users 
            to get this information. Those who do not have ideas to start can browse 
            different color palettes and get great inspiration from those masterpieces. 
            Those who want to learn a specific work can directly use our search bar to 
            search for the work they are interested in and see how the work implements 
            those colors.
