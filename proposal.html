    <h1>Group7: Topic Proposal of Porject1 - Color Web App</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
        
        <p>When creating their own art pieces, many designers 
            and artists would borrow ideas from the masterpieces' 
            palettes. By analyzing the color choices' expressive 
            and conceptual intention, artists gain inspiration and 
            may put them into their own work. This project aims to 
            display and categorize a gallery of famous paintings by 
            their dominating colors. With our web app, artists could 
            choose the paintings to observe and learn more selectively; 
            they may pick based on their interests in the palettes 
            they like. Other than that, showing the dominating colors 
            could help artists to identify the key tone of the paintings 
            more intuitively. At the same time, our web app also 
            encourages ordinary people to appreciate art better.</p>
        
        <p>Nowadays, numerous existing websites collect masterpiece 
            images, while ranking them and displaying them in 
            tile view. However, not many focus on the problem of 
            displaying masters’ color-selections along with art 
            pieces to give the viewer clearer visual perceptions. 
            Under the masterpiece section, Pinterest exhibits a 
            mass of famous paintings along with their name, year, 
            and painter only. Similarly, the website, Artst, is 
            consistent with the same types of information. 
            Compared with Pinterest, it chooses to include 
            more description of the painting's background. 
            Unlike the previous two, the website Color Lisa 
            displays the artists’ names and provides palettes 
            of their most famous paintings. However, it doesn’t 
            include the painting's image; when clicking on the 
            painting’s name, it would direct users to its 
            introductory page, including more detailed 
            information, which also does not fulfill our request.
